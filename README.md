# Gaussian Elimination

## AIM:
To write a program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm

1.Start the program.

2.Get the matrix from user.

3.Using "from numpy as np sys" to import numpy (Ge).

4.Print the result matrices (Gaussian Elimination).
